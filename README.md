This project creates a clock and date display using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The display shows the current time and date in a visually appealing format.

## Features

- Date Display: The project also includes a section that displays the current date in the format "Day, Month Day, Year." It shows the current weekday, day, month, and year.

- Stylish Design: The clock and date display are styled using CSS to create an attractive visual appearance. The clock has a gradient background, text shadow, and a glowing effect.
